## Doing the Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com

I started a day late, so I'm just doing it for fun and to learn some JavaScript.

Using node for my solutions. I was just doing it in Firefox's console to start out with,
but I moved to node on day 3, so I don't have solutions until part 2 of day 3.

I may look into using curl with cookies to get the correct puzzle for my user, but we'll see.
